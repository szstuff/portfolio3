# Portfolio3: A React Portfolio Website Template

When deciding to redesign my portfolio, I realized that it's unnecessarily time-consuming to hard-code projects. **Portfolio3** programmatically loads portfolio items from a config file rather than having the portfolio items hard-coded in.

The name "Portfolio3" simply reflects this project being my third portfolio iteration, with the second being an earlier version of this design with hard-coded content.

## Planned Features and Improvements (after finalising general components/design)

- [ ] Populate landing page info (name, social links, highlighted projects, etc) from config file to facilitate reusing 
- [ ] Generate long text content in a normal text-body, a scroll-view or a list view based on config parameters (as opposed to hard-coding in that e.g. section with key "tech stack" is a list)
- [ ] Set colors using config parameters
- [ ] Refactor and optimize sloppy parts of the code 
- [ ] Make proper documentation to facilitate reuse of the project
